    "body": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nIssue 286\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025\nReading time\n13 min read\nShare\n\nDear friends,\n\nThe buzz over DeepSeek this week crystallized, for many people, a few important trends that have been happening in plain sight: (i) China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI, with implications for the AI supply chain. (ii) Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer, which creates opportunities for application builders. (iii) Scaling up isn’t the only path to AI progress. Despite the massive focus on and hype around processing power, algorithmic innovations are rapidly pushing down training costs.\n\nAbout a week ago, DeepSeek, a company based in China, released DeepSeek-R1, a remarkable model whose performance on benchmarks is comparable to OpenAI’s o1."

The code and weights are licensed freely for commercial and personal use, including training new models on R1 outputs. The paper provides an up-close look at the training of a high-performance model that implements a chain of thought without explicit prompting. (DeepSeek-R1-lite-preview came out in November with fewer parameters and a different base model.)\n\nMixture of experts (MoE) basics: The MoE architecture uses different subsets of its parameters to process different inputs. Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a gating module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the input."

    "body": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nIssue 286\nPublished\nJan 29, 2025\nReading time\n13 min read\nShare\n\nDear friends,\n\nThe buzz over DeepSeek this week crystallized, for many people, a few important trends that have been happening in plain sight: (i) China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI, with implications for the AI supply chain. (ii) Open weight models are commoditizing the foundation-model layer, which creates opportunities for application builders. (iii) Scaling up isn\u2019t the only path to AI progress. Despite the massive focus on and hype around processing power, algorithmic innovations are rapidly pushing down training costs.\n\nAbout a week ago, DeepSeek, a company based in China, released\u00a0DeepSeek-R1, a remarkable model whose performance on benchmarks is comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1. Further, it was released as an open weight model with a permissive MIT license. At Davos last week, I got a lot of questions about it from non-technical business leaders. And on Monday, the stock market saw a \u201cDeepSeek selloff\u201d: The share prices of Nvidia and a number of other U.S. tech companies plunged. (As of the time of writing, they have recovered somewhat.)\n\nHere\u2019s what I think DeepSeek has caused many people to realize:\n\nChina is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI.\u00a0When ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, the U.S. was significantly ahead of China in generative AI. Impressions change slowly, and so even recently I heard friends in both the U.S. and China say they thought China was behind. But in reality, this gap has rapidly eroded over the past two years. With models from China such as Qwen (which my teams have used for months), Kimi, InternVL, and DeepSeek, China had clearly been closing the gap, and in areas such as video generation there were already moments where China seemed to be in the lead.\n\nI\u2019m thrilled that DeepSeek-R1 was released as an open weight model, with a technical report that shares many details. In contrast, a number of U.S. companies have pushed for regulation to stifle open source by hyping up hypothetical AI dangers such as human extinction",

The code and weights are\u00a0licensed\u00a0freely for commercial and personal use, including training new models on R1 outputs. The\u00a0paper\u00a0provides an up-close look at the training of a high-performance model that implements a chain of thought without explicit prompting. (DeepSeek-R1-lite-preview\u00a0came out in November with fewer parameters and a different base model.)\n\nMixture of experts (MoE) basics:\u00a0The MoE architecture uses different subsets of its parameters to process different inputs. Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a gating module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the input. In this way, different experts learn to specialize in different types of examples. Because not all parameters are used to produce any given output, the network uses less energy and runs faster than models of similar size that use all parameters to process every input.\n\nHow it works:\u00a0DeepSeek-R1 is a version of\u00a0DeepSeek-V3-Base\u00a0that was fine-tuned over four stages to enhance its ability to process a\u00a0chain of thought\u00a0(CoT). It\u2019s a mixture-of-experts transformer with 671 billion total parameters, 37 billion of which are active at any given time, and it processes 128,000 tokens of input context. Access to the model via DeepSeek\u2019s\u00a0API\u00a0costs $0.55 per million input tokens ($0.14 for cached inputs) and $2.19 per million output tokens",

    "body": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nIssue 284\nPublished\nJan 15, 2025\nReading time\n13 min read\nShare\n\nDear friends,\n\nWriting software, especially prototypes, is becoming cheaper. This will lead to increased demand for people who can decide what to build. AI Product Management has a bright future!\n\nSoftware is often written by teams that comprise Product Managers (PMs), who decide what to build (such as what features to implement for what users) and Software Developers, who write the code to build the product. Economics shows that when two goods are complements \u2014 such as cars (with internal-combustion engines) and gasoline \u2014 falling prices in one leads to higher demand for the other. For example, as cars became cheaper, more people bought them, which led to increased demand for gas. Something similar will happen in software. Given a clear specification for what to build, AI is making the building itself much faster and cheaper. This will significantly increase demand for people who can come up with clear specs for valuable things to build.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m excited about the future of Product Management, the discipline of developing and managing software products. I\u2019m especially excited about the future of AI Product Management, the discipline of developing and managing AI software products.\n\nMany companies have an Engineer:PM ratio of, say, 6:1. (The ratio varies widely by company and industry, and anywhere from 4:1 to 10:1 is typical.) As coding becomes more efficient, I think teams will need more product management work (as well as design work) as a fraction of the total workforce. Perhaps engineers will step in to do some of this work, but if it remains the purview of specialized Product Managers, then the demand for these roles will grow.\n\nThis change in the composition of software development teams is not yet moving forward at full speed. One major force slowing this shift, particularly in AI Product Management, is that Software Engineers, being technical, are understanding and embracing AI much faster than Product Managers. Even today, most companies have difficulty finding people who know how to develop products and also understand AI, and I expect this shortage to grow.\n\nFurther, AI Product Management requires a different set of skills than traditional software Product Management. It requires:\n\nTechnical proficiency in AI.\u00a0PMs need to understand what products might be technically feasible to build",
